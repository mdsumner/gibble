Description: Translation and restructuring operations for planar shapes and
 other hierarchical types require a data model with a record of the underlying
 relationships between elements. The gibble() function creates a geometry map,
 a simple record of the underlying structure in path-based hierarchical types.
 There are methods for the planar shape types in the 'sf' and 'sp' packages.
